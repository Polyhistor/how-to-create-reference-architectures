\title{A Comprehensive Methodology for Creating and Evolving Reference Architectures}
\author{[Author Name]}
\date{}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for creating, validating, and evolving reference architectures. We address key methodological gaps in the current literature and propose a structured approach that encompasses problem delineation, requirements specification, theory development, architectural design, validation, evaluation, implementation guidelines, and evolution strategies.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Reference architectures play a crucial role in guiding the development of complex systems across various domains \citep{Angelov2012}. However, methodological gaps persist in their creation and evolution...

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}
Existing methodologies for creating reference architectures, such as Galster and Avgeriou's empirically-grounded approach \citep{Galster2011} and Nakagawa's process-based method \citep{Nakagawa2014}, provide valuable insights but have limitations...

\section{Research Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Problem Delineation}
\label{subsec:problem}
The first step in our methodology is a clear delineation of the problem and justification for the reference architecture. This aligns with the problem relevance principle in Design Science Research (DSR) \citep{Hevner2004}...

\subsection{Requirements Specification}
\label{subsec:requirements}
We adopt ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 \citep{ISO29148} for requirements specification, focusing on Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) \citep{Chen2013}. ASRs are particularly relevant for reference architectures as they...

\section{Artefact Design}
\label{sec:design}

\subsection{Theory Development}
\label{subsec:theory}
We propose a two-step theory development process, drawing on DSR principles \citep{Gregor2013}:

\subsubsection{Data Collection and Insight Gathering}
This phase involves systematic literature reviews \citep{Kitchenham2007}, multivocal literature reviews \citep{Garousi2019}, and expert interviews \citep{Bogner2009}. We propose a novel taxonomic approach for categorizing findings...

\subsubsection{Theory Formulation}
Using abductive inference \citep{Dubois2014}, we develop kernel theories and design theories. This process is iterative and...

\subsection{Translating Theories into Architectural Constructs}
\label{subsec:translation}
We propose a rigorous method for translating theories into architectural components, incorporating variability management techniques \citep{Galster2014}...

\subsection{Architectural Representation}
\label{subsec:representation}
We advocate for the use of ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 \citep{ISO42010} and ArchiMate \citep{Lankhorst2017} for standardized architectural representation. This choice is justified by...

\subsection{Component Explanation and Views}
\label{subsec:views}
We propose a comprehensive set of views including structural, behavioral, and deployment models \citep{Kruchten1995}. Each component should be explained in terms of...

\section{Validation and Evaluation}
\label{sec:validation}
We propose a multi-method approach to validation and evaluation, including case studies \citep{Runeson2009}, expert evaluations \citep{Beecham2005}, and simulation \citep{Martens2010}...

\section{Implementation Guidelines}
\label{sec:implementation}
To bridge the gap between abstract architecture and concrete implementation, we propose...

\section{Evolution Strategies}
\label{sec:evolution}
Reference architectures must evolve to remain relevant. We propose strategies for continuous refinement and adaptation \citep{Eixelsberger1998}...

\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:threats}
We acknowledge potential threats to validity in our methodology, including...

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
Our proposed methodology addresses several key limitations of existing approaches...

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper has presented a comprehensive methodology for creating, validating, and evolving reference architectures...
